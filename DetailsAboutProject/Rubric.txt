[3 points]: Program runs and without errors? (check console)
[3 points]: Program is usable e.g. easy to use without confusing behaviour
[3 point]: Image loaded from the webcam
[1 point]: greyscale conversion
[1 point]: brightness increase to 20%
[1 point]: added brightness not to exceed 255 pixel intensity
[1 point]: split image into three channels
[3 points]: perform image thresholding for each channel with a use of a slider to adjust values
[2 points]: colour space conversion #1
[2 points]: colour space conversion #2
[2 points]: perform image thresholding for colour space #1 [1 point if you use static threshold] or [2 points
with a use of a slider to adjust values]
[2 points]: perform image thresholding for colour space #2 [1 point if you use static threshold] or [2 points
with a use of a slider to adjust values]
[2 points]: Face detection works using a bounding box
[1 point]: Replace the detected face image with a greyscale converted image
[1 point]: Replace the detected face image with a blurred image
[2 points]: Replace the detected face image with a colour converted image (check if task 9 is revisited)
[6 points]: Pixelate filter (check for nested loops, correct use of average)
[4 points]: Code presentation: indentation, white space, comments, variable naming
[4 points]: Code competency: code reusability (some functionality is repeated â€“ did student use
functions/OO to organise the code better?)
[8 points]: Commentary included?
[4 points]: Video included?
[14 points]: Has learner implemented any unique ideas for further development? How technically
complex, original and challenging was the idea and its implementation?
